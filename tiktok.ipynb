We had called other places and felt like we were getting taken advantage of it was terribly overwhelming, then I was referred to Stork Mortuary from a family friend. They treated us with patience, respect, and guidance. Times like this your at a complete loss and this man listened and made us feel like we were important and not just a client. I highly recommend going to Stork Mortuary. They worked with our budget and didn't try and push things we didn't need on us. I would have not been able to get through this without the service I received. This company and Leonard went above and beyond to make sure my mother had a beautiful service. Even after service I was contacted to see if I was doing ok and that means a lot. A million thank you's to Leonard and his wife. I will never go to another place.\\n\\nSheila Fuentes\\nOctober 20, 2020\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I should have listened... While we were test driving it we found some issues we wanted them to fix. They SAID they fixed it, so we bought it. I took it to my mechanic the other day and found out that they did NOT fix the issues, and now I have to fix them all myself because, of course, the warranty they sold me doesn't cover it. I messaged Dave the salesmen and told him about it and he looked at my message and did not reply. Typical salesman. On top of all that, they told me there was only one open recall on my car, there are THREE. It's no cost to me, but I work full time and now I have to spend my days off going and getting these fixed.

            "BAD EXPERIENCE, START TO FINISH!!! I made an appointment to see the work truck I wanted to purchase. Upon arrival (73 miles and 1.5 hours away) and updating Shaun of our ETA, the truck would not start because it was not plugged in long before our arrival (Diesel truck). After about an hour of chatting, waiting for the block to warm enough to start we get to the test drive. Everything seemed ok for an older work truck. While negotiating, I asked if they could guarantee the truck would pass emissions. I was told that they could not and that the truck was sold \"As Is\", “Where Is\", as a \"Tow away\".  This should have been a red flag to ME, but I proceeded to buy the truck. After taking the truck in for an oil change, fuel filter change, replacing both batteries, replacing the injector pressure regulator, running injector cleaner and other miscellaneous fixes to the tune of $1000.00, AND finding out that the truck had 2 bad injectors, I took it in for an emissions test. IT FAILED! But, I was told by the testing facility that it was the dealers’ responsibility to provide either a current certificate of passing emissions or at the least a voucher to have the vehicle tested, they provided neither. I contacted the DMV Emissions division to find out if there was any truth to what I was told, and fortunately there was along with the dealers’ option to pay for repairs to bring the truck into compliance or purchase the vehicle back. I called Shaun and explained my findings and what I believed his options to be PER THE STATE. I also informed him that the proper \"Tow Away\" paperwork was never completed. He stood by his belief that it was not his obligation to do anything but did offer to \"point me in the right direction\" to get it fixed. The prompt and knowledgeable gentleman at the DMV took over the complaint that I lodged against High Plaines. He informed me that they would pay for the repairs to bring the truck into compliance; I just had to get the truck to the shop that was in Colorado Springs. Before I could get down there, the truck died on me, forcing me to have it towed to the shop. The shops findings were that the truck was no good. I was then informed by the DMV that they would buy the truck back, but what I had spent on the truck was a loss. I just had to coordinate with Shaun and Jim to do the paperwork and retrieve my personal belongings. I did so, and upon finalizing everything, I asked that I be able to swap the batteries back to the original because the new ones I purchased were still in the truck ($300). I was told that I could not do that and they kept my batteries. Even while finishing up everything, I was told that they didn't do anything wrong and that it was a “new form” that they had missed.... I obviously would not do or recommend anyone do business with them but if you do follow your gut and don’t take their word on anything. If I didn’t do my homework and talk to the DMV, I would have been stuck with a $10,000 mistake.\n",

            "I have welcomed two children through Rose Midwifery, I’m pregnant with my third currently & wouldn’t even consider having my baby anywhere else. I recommend my best friend go there when she found out she was expecting also & she had a wonderful experience with them too. When I was pregnant the first time I originally started with prenatal care at with Lutheran hospital & I frequently left crying & overwhelmed, when I asked about creating a birth plan the male dr actually laughed at me, I asked about potential different birthing positions (squatting, for example- because I had just learned that was possible) and he literally scoffed & scolded me about how they do things their way at their hospital, that HE was the DR, it was his job to deliver babies & I should stop questioning the way they do things there. FORTUNATELY  I went home and did a google search & quickly found Rose Midwifery, which was a bit more of a drive for me but it was the best decision I could have made for my growing family. I’m truly so grateful to have the opportunity to have another baby through the attentive, nurturing Rose Midwifery staff.\n",

            "Edit- I wanted to add, because I read a lot of other reviews where people complained about seeing a different staff member every visit, pretty sure they do that so you have an opportunity to meet all the midwives because you will have one of them deliver your baby depending on who’s working the day you give birth. They want you to have had the chance to meet all of them, which I for one found really awesome. Yes, we all have a specific staff member we click with, but the odds of her being on call when you deliver are a gamble. Also, while I have had to wait ONCE maybe 15-20 mns after my scheduled appointment time to be seen, I’ve also arrived 15 mns early when no one else was there waiting & was seen right away. Never had to wait more than 20mns though, and the waiting room is comfortable, they offer refreshments & have plenty of reading material if your phone battery is dead. If you bring your kids with you to your appointment they have crayons and loads of pictures for your little one to color & always hang them up. Everyone is so thoughtful there.\n",

This last time they installed new front speakers, the 2nd to cheapest option they had and once they were installed I noticed they crackle. The guy told me it's because I didn't get the upgrade, something about a stock amp conflicting with the speakers and it would cost another $400 to correct the issue.

Ever since, I've made a point to book her monthly facials as a part of my self care commitment. (except for 2020 quarantine, of cource) Now, I'm not a millionaire, or not even close to be wealthy. Julie offers a generous package of monthly facial club full of great services, that a regular working girl like me can afford it and feel like it's way worth the time and effort to visit her.  She is always professional, so giving of her skills and knowledge, and also darn funny.  It's like stopping by every month to see a friend, and somehow end up looking beautiful by the time you leave.\n",

            "Horrible experience.  I found a coupon and read reviews so I trusted this company.  In my opinion, the tech Joe was not very forthcoming. He quoted me a price which was double the coupon & stated because he was giving me such a great deal he should get a significant tip. Who tells people that? I told him I  would tip him if he does a good job. He then wrote some things on my work order and told me to sign it. I stupidly did not read the fine print. He wrote \"No guarantee,  no redos, price reduced so customer can afford, price should be doubled, $125 for return treatments of any kind\" AND he said my carpets were never cleaned before which is NOT true. He clearly new how to protect himself. What about the customer? His business ethics are questionable in my opinion. I felt totally violated. I paid  $268 plus a $50 cash tip for a service I felt he did negligently. I only tipped him because he commented about a significant tip. He soaked my stairs and my house smelled horribly. It took over a week to dry. My husband called the owner who twice did not show up to see the carpet.  He never returned our calls. I was not asking for anything except to fix Joe's negligence.  Never happened!!  Think twice before using this company. I felt like Joe took advantage of me. What a horrible representative of a so called reputable company.\n",

            "Steam Wave of Castle Rock is the most unprofessional business I have ever dealt with in all of Colorado.  My husband was at work when they arrived. Clay (the owner) came into my house with a poor attitude and was gruff.  His coupon was as follows: 3 rooms (220 SQFT or less is considered a room) for $99.00 for the fast dry.  We have two rooms on our first level measuring 213.5 SQFT in the living room and 200 SQFT for the dining room.\n",
            "\n",
            "When we came in, he said “what areas are we doing”, and I showed him the areas.  Since we only have two areas on the first level, with every other carpet cleaning company we’ve ever done business with always use the 3rd area as the staircase.  He said, “nope, I don’t swap out areas for a staircase, and that living room is an oversized room and will be charged as two…there’s your third room.”  I measured it and it measured at 213.5 SQFT, his coupon said 220 SQFT or more.  I pointed this out, but he argued with me and measured the room differently, not compensating for an area that is not carpeted, or a large corner of our room where the entertainment center sits and he would not be cleaning that corner, since it is too large of a piece of furniture to move.  I told him we have used at least 5 other cleaning companies over the past 5 years and NEVER once has any other company told us our living room is oversized or is counted as 2 rooms.  He then added a $31.95 gas/mileage fee (even though we live in Castle Rock and his business is located in Castle Rock). I told him I was uncomfortable with the price and gas charge, especially since he was only cleaning 2 areas and we live in the town his business is located. His response in a raised voice was, “want me to leave?!! I’ll leave! I’ve got other jobs to go do! Just tell me what you want. I’ve built this business for 10 years and I have a good reputation and I do a good job. I AM cleaning 3 areas, that room is 2 rooms in one”. In speaking the way he did to me, I cannot see how he would have a good reputation!! He then told me “what a good deal” I was getting because right now his prices are $159 for what I was paying $99 for. I said, “really? Because I was just on your website and the price listed there is $109”. His response was, “that’s a new website and it’s not up to date yet. I’m talking about my page thru Google. I pay Google $2,000 a month and I have costs I have to offset too ya know!”.\n",
            "He started raising his voice, yelling at me, to the point that our son ran to hide and was afraid.  This man, the owner of the company, is THE MOST unprofessional person I ever met and have ever dealt with.  Liar, dishonest, disrespectful, and using intimidation tactics to force his way.

            "I cannot remember the last time a Doctor took so much time with me!  (Actually, no doctor has ever spent more than 10 mins with me, aside from Dr. Hope) I was rushing in traffic to get home, and she called right on time and worked with me anyway over the phone, even though I almost didn't make the appointment! She was flexible and I didn't have to miss it and I so appreciated that!  Dr. Hope is kind, listens wonderfully, is extremely knowledgeable and patient. Her questions about my symptoms showed me that she has seen many complexities in many different people. She was compassionate and seemed genuinely interested and confident in her experience. I have another appointment next week with her, and feel as if I am in the BEST hands. Something made me click on her site and find her, out of all the places in the world and the vast internet! So grateful! Highly reccommended!\n",

            "Icouldnt give high enough praise as a doctor and as a wonderful and caring person and doc! I absolutely love my Doctor, Dr. Courtney Crance, she never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge and determination to help her patients to the best of her ability and the upmost care. She has an amazing bedside manner and is genuine, very knowledgeable and I couldn't even imagine having to have gone through this last year without her, after my other amazing doctor changed fields of practice and I didn't qualify for his new place of work. I am more impressed more and more by Courtney with each and  every visit with her. If there is something that is unknown, she does all she can to research it and figure out what is the cause and doesn't give up or blow things off as unimportant. She has made the quality of my life improve at least 10 fold with new knowledge of my illnesses and issues, and having knowledge that is different and an alternative to what hasn't been working to another alternative that has had wonderful results and benefits for me. I am able to do so much more in life and I am not as limited as I had been for decades. It's a whole new world...yes, cue the little mermaid music! Lol The staff is wonderfully friendly, helpful and keep the atmosphere within the office uplifting, lighthearted and are all very friendly and good at their jobs. The office as a whole flows and works very well together and do everything possible to help solve, treat, cure if possible and do whatever they possibly can or to at least improve the situation to improve ones quality of life. I can't thank all of them enough! Thank you for you wonderful care and efforts towards figuring all of my issues out, so they can be treated as best as possible so I am now able to work at least part time, which I haven't been able to do for over 15 years now. Thanks a million for all you do, as a whole and individually! You all rock! <EMOJI><EMOJI><EMOJI><EMOJI>\n",

I explained to the person i was msging that my work was making it very hard to see them and the times she was giving me wasnt going to work  My depression and anxiety has hit an all time high and i desperately needed help so i called the only place i knew (this one) and ask to talk to somone. This is when i was told that they would no longer see me again becuase there a small practice and i wasited her time and money. Even though she was trying to see me early in the month to redo a better time but now it different. The way i was spoken to in my time off need has hurt me greatly and now i fully think that this place doesnt care about your mental heath at all stay away please. This is not where you go to feel better this is where you go to pay people to not care about you. Update!!!

            "If I could give them no stars, know that I would. I have endometriosis and had heard that one of the doctors here knew quite a bit about that so I made an appointment to see her. I recently moved to Colorado Springs from Denver and *apparently* my insurance was a problem because of that. Either way I got a written letter from my insurance and jumped through all the hoops just so I could see this doctor. Three times I had to reschedule my appointment off of their orders because \"the papers haven't gone through\" or \"we're just not allowed to see you\". The day of my pre-op I received a phone call saying I wasn't allowed to come in or get my pre-op because of my insurance, they called a mere 30 minutes before my appointment and I had called the day prior to confirm everything was good to go and was told it was. My father and I showed up anyways with all of our paperwork and the letter from the Head of my insurance company giving me permission to see this doctor (and yes my father joined me because I've been dealing with horrible doctors and I'm not great at standing up for myself, not to mention I'm so ill I can't drive myself anywhere). Once we walked in and asked to speak to one of the manager ladies to try to figure out what was going on THEY CALLED THE COPS ON US. Said we had \"threatened them\". The doctor I was supposed to see even came out crying to the police saying how awful we were and how we made her feel unsafe (even though this was the first time I'd seen her that day and before this she had promised me she'd work with me to figure out the insurance to get my surgery???) needless to say, im angry, no, I'm beyond angry. These people are absolutely deplorable! They fought us on every front, every time we fixed a \"problem\" (which was truly a made up one on THEIR end not my insurances end) they came up with a billion others. I had paid OUT OF POCKET for my first visit because they hadn't informed me of the issue prior to me showing up and my mother had come up all the way from Denver to help me. They should all be ashamed of themselves, if they don't want to work with people who aren't having babies then just say so!\n",

            "I took my 1995 Ford F-350 to Northern Colorado Diesel Service exclusively for the purpose of having an oil leak repaired. I knew I had a faulty alternator, and a \"check engine light\" (CEL). I took the truck to the shop b/c it was leaking oil all over the street in front of my house and I wanted to stop this immediately before it caused a large permanent oil spot on my newly paved street. I knew where the oil was leaking from at the front of the plenum and I explained this to the service rep. When I came to p/u the vehicle, they had not repaired the oil leak, but instead informed me that I had a faulty alternator, which they believed to be causing the CEL. I knew this already and had made it clear this was not the purpose of my visit. The rep also stated that I had a fuel leak in addition to the oil leak. They said that the defective alternator was causing the CEL, and recommended changing the fuel lines, which they claimed were leaking. The source of the oil leak (I had already explained this when I dropped the truck off, as it was plain to see) was the HPOP resevoir. I agreed to replace the reservoir cover / gasket and fuel lines, and they ordered the parts (about $150 total). Before returning, I replaced the alternator with a new OEM unit the following week and took the vehicle back to have the oil/fuel leak repaired a week after that. Tony, the service rep called me the following day and said my truck was ready to p/u. When I arrived to p/u my vehicle, just as they were closing, Tony informed me that the part they ordered (that was causing the oil leak) was the wrong part, but that the tech had pulled out the \"non-serviceable plug\" (located on the exterior of that cover), applied sealer to it and re-installed it, claiming this had stopped the oil leak. I was then presented with a bill for over $600, of which a portion was $57 for the \"diagnosis\" they had done 2 weeks prior. I did not authorize the tampering of the non-serviceable plug (which Ford calls a non-serviceable plug b/c it is not supposed to be serviced) and disputed the charges based on the fact that I did not authorize this repair and that there was an additional $57 \"diagnostic\" charge added, for a total of $114 in diagnostic charges for items I explicitly requested be repaired (no need to \"diagnose\"). I also argued that the charges to replace the fuel lines were exorbitant / unreasonable. The fact is, when a repair shop has your vehicle, you don't get it back until you pay the bill... so I paid it. The truck was brought around to me and delivered it to me running. After a few miles, I noticed that the check engine light was on and it never went off the whole way home. In the past, the CEL had always gone off upon reaching operating temp. I was extremely disappointed and barely got the truck home. That weekend, I went out to start the truck and it would not start at all. It still will not start and beneath it is a noticeable oil spot caused by the leak for which I originally took it in to have fixed. I had the truck towed to another shop and upon bringing the truck indoors, I noticed the smell of diesel fuel that was still leaking from somewhere in the plenum. I had the oil changed at a cost of another $150, and the truck still will not start. So in the end, they did not fix the oil leak, which is the only issue I requested be repaired, they did not fix the fuel leak, which they said was vital, I'm out $603, and now my truck will not start or run as a result. Horrible experience!\n",

Every step of the process was a breeze and our yard has never been more gorgeous!  First, Bob met with us to present our options and explain the Plush Grass product.  He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and thorough with our questions.  Joseph then worked to get us scheduled and was impressively patient in working with our other contractors.  Martin, Mark and crew did the final install and without a doubt, I have never seen a more happy but hardworking group of young men.  They showed up early and with a smile on their faces.  Throughout the day, they worked tirelessly bringing in the rock base, leveling/stamping the ground and installing the turf, all the while laughing, singing and joking with each other.  The crew not only worked the entire day to make every aspect of our project perfect but also completely cleaned up after themselves.  From the beginning to the end, we were extremely impressed by the friendly customer service we received as well as the level of skill and expertise that the Plush Grass employees exhibited.  Our children couldn't be more thrilled too have a big yard of beautiful grass and we are definitely the envy of our neighborhood with the greenest yard on the block!

            "I've experienced extremely great service and exceptionally terrible service here. The dentist you get makes all the difference. Dr. Hicks is outstanding and Dr. Skoretz is horrendous.\n",
            "\n",
            "The good: Dr. Hicks is an amazing dentist. She's kind, professional, and I believe genuinely cares about her patients. I'm prone to cavities, (and I definitely eat too much sugar) so I've had 4 cavities filled by her. She always checks to make sure I'm fully numb before going too far. Also, I never feel her numbing injections! Seriously, she's one of the best dentists  I've seen.\n",
            "\n",
            "My experience with Dr. Skoretz was like something out of a nightmare. I had to get a tooth pulled and I was given the numbing injection. He started by prodding my tooth along the gums and I let him know that I could feel that and it was hurting. He then prodded the other side of my mouth (hard!) to show me that it would hurt a lot more without the numbing. He then started to pull out the tooth, and I was in a ton of pain. I let him know it was hurting me, and to stop - tears started welling up in my eyes from how much it hurt. He told me he couldn't work on me because he stated that I was numbed and that the pain was all in my head. He then walked out, and the assistant brought me a reference for an oral surgeon. I left without saying anything because I was in so much pain and I was in complete shock. I have never been talked down to like that from a man without standing up for myself. My tooth is now broken in places and I can feel sharp shards of tooth pushing in my gums because he started the process but stopped. I am in a lot of pain.\n",

            "I recently visited this office after extensive research on local dental offices. I chose them because of their stellar reviews online. During my visit I realized why so many people love them.  I haven't been to the dentist for a while because I have had unpleasant and painful experiences in the past. Everyone who works their is extremely friendly and made me feel comfortable. I had a cleaning and some fillings and the whole visit was pain free and actually enjoyable. Dr. Lynn is awesome and did my fillings very quickly which I loved. They also took the time to go over everything that needed to be done and throughly went over the costs with me. They did not charge anything unnecessary and were not trying to push anything on me. I am very pleased to have found and great dentist and they will be my choice for all my dental work in the future.\n",

We've had quite a few problems with our engine and have had it serviced at McDonald Audi several times in the last few months, with which we were highly dissatisfied.   He read our extensive previous service history thoroughly and upon inspecting the car recommended that we take it back to the dealership that did the previous service, as it should still be under 12 months/12000 miles warranty.  He showed us patiently all of the problems he found.  I've never been under a car with the mechanic showing me what is wrong before.  It was pretty cool.  We will bring this car back to Chris for inspection when McDonald is done with it, and for all future oil changes, repairs, everything.  He really went the extra mile and made us feel really comfortable and safe, something we've never felt in dealing with the dealership to date.  Highly recommended.\n",

I told them i only have $20 right now since I was unaware. They would not accept it. So I wasn’t able to be seen. The thing is I’ve never had a balance before and they should have told me about it prior to my appointment so I could have been prepared. Office manager was cold and uncaring that I’ve been in pain waiting for this appointment. And unwilling to at least take a partial payment.

            "I've been consistently happy with Dr. Opperman as an ENT Specialist. I went in to him after constant issues with Nasal Polyps, a Deviated Septum, and Turbinate issues. He explained exactly what was going on, what he'd like to do in order to remedy the issue surgically, and explained the post op recovery process. Because I was having so many issues, I decided to go ahead and get the surgery, and I cannot speak highly enough about the process. It completely changed my life. Before I was constantly sick with sinus infections, having morning sickness because of how much post-nasal dripping I would experience at night. Ever since the surgery, I haven't been sick once, and all morning sickness went away. I now can breathe easily out of both of my nostrils, and am feeling much healthier. I cannot recommend Dr. Opperman enough, he has been amazing throughout the entire process. If you're looking for an ENT in the Denver Metro Area, Dr. Opperman should be your FIRST choice.\n",

Horrible customer service. Too many back end fees to list, that you don't find out about until AFTER this company already has your belongings in their possession, so all you can do is pay. I have never been more disappointed in a provided service. However, from their standpoint, it's more like you're doing them a favor by gracing them with your business. The guy in the office, the \"manager\", was very disrespectful - over talking and extremely condescending, nasty attitude. The only good guys of the bunch were the drivers - who are contracted out so they're not even part of Safeway Movers. Fun fact- we specifically told by the \"manager\" they do not contract out and we'd be dealing with their drivers. I never received even a hint of an apology for numerous un-returned phone calls, rather I was told they always call back and I must be mistaken. So, now I'm a liar??? Nice. The pick up date changed 3 times, of which we were notified by text. They were scheduled to pick up late morning-afternoon; they didn't arrive until 8 pm. The drop off date changed from 2-3 days to 3-5 days. The office failed to notify the 3rd party trucking company we would need a shuttle delivery to the storage unit so there was an additional day delay. Oh...we only needed the shuttle service (an extra minimum cost of $350) because we were not told that the storage unit had to be 18 wheeler accessible.

            "1. The facility is impressive, with plenty of space to run 2-3 classes at the same time.  Additionally, the equipment is high-quality stuff.  No flashy/gimmicky products at this gym.  Another sticking point is the upstairs recovery room, which members can use at no extra charge.  The infrared sauna and Normatec compression system are fantastic resources to use after a tough workout.\n",
            "2.  Coaches can make or break a gym, and Crossfit LTP employs high-quality trainers.  Jason, Bobby, and Justin do a fantastic job getting to know each member and tailoring each workout to fit the needs of the individual.

It's great motivation to keep the positive momentum going!\n",

            "Wasson was the best school in the Springs. We  learned more and had so much other schools couldn't touch. like,  the huge indoor pool. the football stadium , the archery court, tennis courts, in house fresh food from the cafeteria  the huge autormin , the chore, drama clubs, the best wood and metal shops, the best place to learn how to cook had plenty of small kitchens. Proud to be Thunderbirds bar none the glee club, Football year after year winning ,  Drama classes were great. Plenty of other school clubs, the gynitises team. We study hard and enjoyed being there. Yes it had it problems but in all fairness it was the best toward the student. Bar None. My senior class was the last before the busing started and I heard it changed. I know of one person who suffered from others over mix dating. Sad but all busing did was spread the violence to all areas. My class of 1971 was the last to really enjoy the school. It had so much to offer that other schools did not have. I loved so many of my teachers and some not.  I wish the students after our class could have enjoyed it.\n",

            "I had an exercise-induced lower back injury during a crossfit workout that severely limited my range of motion. I tried streching it and rolling it out and could not get this extreme pain and discomfort to go away.  I knew that Andrew was a chiropractor, and I asked if he might be able to help. I was a bit hesitant at first because I had never been to a chiropractor before. To my surprise, Dr. Cuiffo was able to completely ELIMINATE the pain and discomfort and I actually ended up feeling BETTER than I did prior to my injury.

Since we have added three country flags and two incredible custom pieces.  With a move from Colorado to Wyoming we wanted to capture our love for both states.  Craig created a two piece, attachable/detachable pub table as our first custom job! One piece’s table top is the Colorado state flag, the other the Wyoming state flag.  It is beautiful and definitely one of a kind!  There has never been a person that has walked into our home and not been blown away by the uniqueness and craftsmanship.  Just this past weekend we picked up our second custom piece; a reclaimed wood wall hanging depicting our new golf community’s logo with our closing date.  Words do not do justice to how happy we are with the end result. The craftsmanship and attention to detail are impressive for all five of Craig’s projects that are featured in our home!\n",

            "I have a handful of apartments in Denver and my main house here. I started using My Denver Plumber back in 2011, when Zane was running things, and have continued to use them up until now (and in fact just gave them a call for something on my main house).     My experience with each of the plumbers involved here has been just great.   So far I have found them to be very very good on price, and very helpful when it comes to thinking of less expensive yet still effective ways of getting things done.  And they are very good at telling me when I don't need to do things as well, they have saved me money time and again -- in fact, one time I had already purchased a new garbage disposal for one of my units and their plumber told me to wait just a minute on installing it, ran some tests on the existing disposal because he said it looked like a high quality one then got it unjammed, and told me to return the new one. He literally saved me $250 right then and there.\n",

I really cannot say enough, I recommend them to all of my home owning friends.   Only negative thing I might say is that there have been times I haven't been able to get them in as quick as I might like,  but that is denver over the past few years -- it is really hard to get on the calendar for folks unless it is an emergency. Way too much work out there for plumbers and electricians these days!   That being said, I still recommend these guys. All my experiences have been top notch, and when I have gone to others I get quotes that are like seriously way more $$  (and just way more than the job I am asking about should cost!!!).   Unless something changes for the negative, these are the guys I call first each time.\n",

In February keeping up with these activities became increasingly difficult because of my lingering back issues that I left untreated for years. Having been an athlete all my life, I just kept putting things on the back burner until I became very limited. I came to Health and Harmony Chiropractic when I basically could not move my neck at all anymore. I started treatment and I’m getting a ton better. I’m able to start coming back to all of my activities that keep me happy. The issue in my neck is completely gone! I have learned better ways to carry myself and to take care of myself along the way. I had never been to a chiropractor before. Health and Harmony has taught me a lot of useful information about the human body, about anatomy, and how taking care of your spine affects the rest of the body and how it can function or not function. Understanding the spines role in the body really helped me in this process.\n",

I've never been one to accept the band-aid approach for problem solving and so I knew I needed to make some serious life changes.

Prior to the Chinese Medicine Clinic, I had gone through many doctors before and tried many prescriptions that never helped alleviate symptoms from my health issues.

After my first appointment, I kept coming back and almost immediately felt a difference in my mental and physical health. Acupuncture was stress-relieving for me, and it along with herbs helped me with my health condition. I went to Hadyn for several months and my quality of life has definitely improved. Unfortunately, I moved to Colorado and couldn't take this clinic with me but Haydn sent me off with a supply to last about 2 months. Now that I'm in another state, he's even been helpful enough to research new Chinese Medicine doctors for me and personally contact them.

As a consumer, it is my right to exercise whichever vehicle I see fit to voice my views.  It was mortifying to be chastised in a place of business for my personal opinion & frustration with my first encounter.  All businesses grow, or not, by word of mouth and reputation.  While both (reputation and growth) are of utmost concern to the owners, treating a paying customer in that manner doesn’t speak well to character or business ethics.

            "The owner of this store doesn't have a clue. I brought in an all matching WW2 K98 for a safety replacement.  There were three other people in the store sitting around including the owner and the first thing they are tell me is that I can get a gun like this for 200.00 all day. That I got ripped off. Now this late war BYF44 K98 is rare because the stock has never been messed with and the bluing was still beautiful on this gun not to mention it still has an original sling that has never been taken off or oiled and it is well marked. The sling for christ sake is worth 150.00!!! He said , \" I got a few K98's in the back\", and I said let me see them because if you have all matching k98's for any price close to 200.00, I'll be buying them all day! The owner said,\" Well that's what I get them for.\" Of course he never showed me any K98's even though I asked to see them. I was never offered any gun service by the owner at any time. The owner then offered that another gentleman sitting there who supposedly had great knowledge on K98's to work on it!!! He started to fiddle around with the bolt and locked it up because of the lack of the safety. Then that guy gave me his card and said, \"Bring it by and I'll fix it for you.\" I thought like hell you will and walked out and found a professional gunsmith down in the Springs. I will never go there again!!!! This place is a joke!!!\n",

I called Peak and was able to get an appointment with a PA three days later. All of the staff were very friendly and kind! I saw Michael Hugus (spelling? website and business card are different!) He was very nice, knowledgeable and reassuring. He did a laryngoscopy which was quick and completely painless. He showed me the video and explained his findings, which included signs/changes from reflux. He gave me a treatment plan and answered all of my questions, I did not feel rushed. I highly recommend Peak! They got me in fast, I was in the waiting room less than five minutes, waited less than 2 minutes before he came in and started the exam.

After the lesson the teacher proceeded to take her hand and bring her directly to me. When I asked how she did the teacher replied \"Alright I guess\". The teacher seemed annoyed. When I walked up to the reception desk to receive the refund of the enrollment fee like I was promised and to schedule her next lesson I saw the teacher there speaking with the lady working. She then proceeded to ask me, in front of my daughter \"Does SHE have a disability!?\" I responded well, yes she is blind in her left eye but this has NEVER been a problem in gymnastics nor her schooling. The teacher says \"Ok, ok, I wish someone had told me\" like it was a problem and she needed to be informed. I have never been questioned by her gymnastics or school about this impairment. Very disgusting and unprofessional. Apparently this company doesn't know how to treat children. Needless to say I've been asking for a refund for months now and was lied to saying it was send to my house. Still haven't received it. NEVER recommending this place to anyone.\n",

            "I hired Balance Point to install a QuietCool whole house fan and attic fan into my home.  My appointment was scheduled for a Monday between 10 and 11 am.  I took one of my few precious vacation days off from work so that I could be home for the install.  At 11:15 am, I called the Balance Point office to find out the status of the install because no one had called or arrived yet.  I was informed by Karen that I was on the schedule and that the installers \"must be running late\" and would be heading out to me soon.  When no one had arrived by 2:00 pm, I called the office again.  I was finally called back by Callen and he informed me that the installers would not be able to make it out to me that day.  I was stuck with them though because I had signed a contract, so I rescheduled.\n",
            "\n",
            "The installers arrived at the rescheduled appointment and they were professional and clean.  However, I had ordered a second remote control for the fan, which the installers did not have with them because it wasn't on the job sheet.  They made arrangements to arrive back at my house later in that same day to set up the second remote.  Instead, the sales guy, Ben, scheduled for Thursday at 3:00 pm to bring out the second remote.  At 4:00 I called Ben, because I still had not heard from him and he called me back at 4:15 to let me know that he wouldn't make it out to my house after all.  When Ben did finally come the following, he arrived unprepared without a ladder and he left me with insulation hanging out of the hatch and on the floor when he departed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another aspect of the job was to install a set of roof vents by their contracted roofer.  When I contacted the roofer he informed me that he had never been alerted of the job by Balance Point.  He said he would call me back as soon as he got my job information.  Over a week later and I still hadn't heard back from him.  I asked Ben and he blamed the roofer saying that he had left many voicemails for them.  When I was contacted by the roofer, I asked him about that and he told me that he hadn't been called and he was still waiting for the job information from Balance Point, a full 10 days after the install (and my payment) of my fan systems.  I tend to believe the roofer.\n",

            "Now that we have bought a home and know we won't be renting again I want to expand on my one star for this company. We first started a lease agreement with real property management in 2017. We had a cluase added into the first agreement that if I didnt have proof of employment turned in by a certain time the contract would be voided. Me and my husband had found a home closer to our children's school and wanted to instead go with that rental management company. Mind you, this was before I turned in my proof of employment so the contact was not legal. When I informed Tom of our plan, he said he had already pushed the contract through (without my proof of employment) and insinuated we would not get our deposit back that we had already paid. Even though in all reality that contract should have never been pushed forward without my proof of employment. We were also told the train next to the property only ran once a day. That train ran by at least four times a day, two of those times between 11  and 4 am. When moving from that property to another with the same management company we had the carpets professionally cleaned and the home professionally cleaned per the contract agreement. The property we moved into was filthy, including the carpets. We were expected to do the professional cleaning at our previous rental and then moved into one that had not had that done. When we moved out of the last property we were sent a total of move out charges. One of thos included a charge for an exterminator. The discription was they saw a single flea jump from the wall. 1. We did not have fleas 2. And when we asked for the invoice for that suposed extermination they could not produce one. We were refunded that cost, but I have a feeling there is a lack of integrity when it comes to refunded deposits. Long story short, I would not reccomended this property management to anyone.\n",

The staff and administrators truly care about the student population and bend over backward trying to make sure that quality education is provided.  We are a military family, and guidance counselors are easily accessible and listen carefully to students and families.   The honors courses are appropriately challenging and the homework load is also appropriate for students who work hard to achieve success.  I know the swimming program is fantastic, we could not have asked to have our daughter be a part of a more cohesive team.  I have also heard that the band and drama programs are stellar.  The athletic program is great, but I wish fees were better explained to the parents.  Also, as mentioned by Byron in another review, parking is a righteous nightmare....I am not surprised I saw quite a few fender benders over the years...the traffic situation needs help.  Also, as with any high school theft and drugs are an issue.  I think there are too many blind spots for security to handle and security for the school needs to be reassessed.\n",

            "Absolutely terrible service. I was having a good day until I had to ship my package. I came in on the phone with my mother and patiently waiting in line. When the lady saw me she looked at me then went to the back. So I stayed in line then another customer came in she asked him if she could help him. Confused I asked why I haven't been served while I was standing in line before him. She told me she wasn't going to assist me because I was on the phone. Then she continues to say she won't have two conversations with me then continues to ignore me. When I spoke to the manager who seemed not surprised nor interested in what I told him his employee said to me. He said it was a policy (most likely a lie) saying that a employee should ask a customer to get off the phone while they're shipping a package. Even if it is policy they need to teacher their employees something called customer service. You need to know how to speak to someone. The lady in the front didn't have a name tag and the manger didn't have on one either. I don't know if this happened because I am black or because I'm young.\n",

Living in a small cul-de-sac we were often skipped or missed. When I would call to see why my trash wasn't collected I would be told things like \"Too many cars parked in the cul-de-sac we couldn't get the truck in there.\" another company told me \"if your neighbor parks too close to your cans and we are unable to reach them with the claw without getting out of our truck to physically move the cans, you will be skipped. You need to take this up with your Neighbor.\"\n",

They always respond quickly to let me know that my trash will be picked up a day later due to a holiday earlier in the week or that they were just running a little late due to weather. It really brings in a personal touch being able to contact the directly and not sitting on hold for long periods of time. Last week, I was out of town and unable to take my cans to the curb.

They kept calling me the queen, Idk why but it was cool! The pedicure was pricy, but amazing! They soaked, removed caliuce, did a seat salt scrub and massaged with hot rock! I felt so relaxed and pampered! However I wouldn't do the pedicure again because it was almost $30 and I've had better pedicures at other places for way cheaper. But it was soo nice if you are okay with the price! I also got acrylics with all pink powder for $45 again, pretty pricey in my opinion but they looked soo good. I don't think I've ever been happier with the way my nails looked. It did take forever though so I wouldn't go if you are in a hurry.

            "My children have been going for a year and I have recently had to find them an appropriate facility as antlers place isn't one anymore. My kids were hospitalized due to improper sanitation and sick kids not being called, which is so unfair to those poor kids and their parents who undoubtedly would have taken them home if called but hey, the center cares more about its numbers than health. After Melissa Downs telling me she was the director when I called to complain (she's not, Rebecca is) I called the enrollment center and Julie sent someone over to re teach sanitation and sick leave. Since then she has literally been making faces at me, refusing to talk to my kids when they are dropped off while greeting other kids in front of them, and when I told Rebecca she told me I was making it up. My poor kids are being treated badly and ignored by the staff because the center got them sick and I spoke out. Terrible place and their only saving grace is their teachers, who I have seen have a high turnover rate and have heard it's because they can't stand management either. Don't put your kids here. Also Melissa was telling another mom the mashed potatoes tasted like cardboard when she was going over the menu with a mom with a picky eater and my kids always say they are hungry when I pick them up so there food is horrible (as Melissa said herself).\n",

            "Ok I have to admit that I have never attended an auction in Woodland Park and have never been been to any auction or any store run by SYS Auctions. Yet I have had an experience. So, I guess they used to have Friday night auctions and I was looking forward to that. Yet upon calling I was told that they were maybe not going to do that for a while but that they had another idea, and that was SUNDAY afternoon auctions. PERFECT. No one else in this area that I know of does Sunday auctions. What does an auction nut like myself do on Sundays? Exactly, we go into withdrawals. So, we put it on our calendar and then I received this call. It was the OWNER of SYS telling me that he had to cancel the auction and he apologized. There were several reasons but part of it was a prediction of CRAZY snow for the area. The POINT is that he CALLED ME. Talking about personal service. He saved me from a long drive. What a nice guy. Auctions are all about honesty, caring about your customer, and mostly fun. Yes the adrenaline and yes the sweet deals and steals. But give me a guy who calls me to save me a trip? Damn.\n",

            "I don't have an experience here but a friend of mine went here in which she was physically assaulted by the Staff and the other patients. After going to a higher up about her sexual assault they threw her in isolation for \"telling fibs\" guys she 16. In isolation she was fed once that week and when she started getting sick did they give her week old food. Which in turn gave her a stomach flu. These staff do not care about the patients lord only knows why they are working there they can't be making barely any money, my friend told me that the staff treat the patients so much worse than the \"mentally ill\" patients do. The staff have been accused of rape and neglect. if this was any foster parent or any other parent they would be charged with child abuse neglect and even rape and first degree molestation. I strongly advise you do not send your loved one here they will leave more mentally ill than before and they will be traumatized why in the hell would a mom or a parent waste their money sending the child they love so much there just for them to get worse. If you have truly gone through all of the reviews you will see that this place is hell on earth no exaggeration needed. Satan lives inside those walls and i don't mean within the girls I mean within the staff. And while I am being very forward about my friend's experience I would like to explain the black eye and bruises that was found all over her body after leaving isolation which is when I came with her mom to get her, they charged us $500 to release her but we paid no problem it was worth it I strongly feel that if she would have stayed in there any longer, like many of the patients she would have committed suicide. Rip to the poor girls that took their life due to the abuse and neglect. Please PLease Please reconsider your decision to send your child here. You will eventually regret it. and Excelsior I will write reviews every week I will call every week I will do everything in my power to bring to light the harm and TORTURE you are bringing upon these poor girls. I WILL do everything to shut this hell hole down and I won't stop until the shoes on the other foot and you are sitting in jail enduring the torture you brought upon these girls.

            "As far as the therapists go, I give them 4 stars as I thought they were pretty good.  My real issue is when I was in a rush to go home and was stopped by the girl at the desk saying I owe them money.  I asked her what she meant because all I knew is they sent me their bill, which matched the EOB I received from my insurer, and they cashed my check.  Her response questioned her own company's billing process and then hands me a business card expecting me to spend time calling their billing department on the spot to sort this out.  Thought that was unprofessional and a real turn off.  Then I get a message at my home the next day from their billing department in Montana about me having questions. I had no questions, but I did call my insurance company, who confirmed all was correct.  I haven't been back since, even though my treatment isn't complete.  I also felt at times that their main goal was how many appointments they could get because on the couple of occasions I needed to cancel, I felt some pushback.  Even had one individual ask me for the specific reason stating he had to enter it.  Thought that was intrusive.  Thankfully I'm doing pretty well now, but have already investigated other providers in the event I need more follow up.\n",

Teachers are very knowledgeable about subjects, there is a lot of freedom, they give you multiple opportunities, and etc. It is a great school to go to or to send you children to. Years ago, I heard that the school wasn't that close, but in recent years they have really worked on the school becoming a community and a family. People are very nice to one another, and if there is a bad situation such as bullying, the staff will handle it appropriately. Also, students have tons of freedom, they have a range of classes each year that they can take, and each year that range gets bigger and bigger. Also it is an open campus, where you can leave during lunch and go anywhere you want. (By the way there are a lot of restaurants nearby that is in walking distance).

It does not benefit to tell the truth about the other parent. I would have been much better off if I lied to her about what I was dealing with.

We were able to obtain the report which spoke of him choking a woman unconscious. She also failed to speak to the girlfriend after me who also experienced domestic violence to the point that she was too afraid to speak in court.

He was personable, knowledgeable about my neighborhood and so professional.  His experience made the whole process so easy.  He seemed genuinely excited about my home and did an exceptional job of marketing it, with the result that my home was under contract at full price after less than a week.  And he continued his support and assistance after closing.  I was lucky to find him. He's truly one of the best!   \n",

There were others that over priced us, complained about how hard the job would be, and didn't show up when they were supposed too.  This company had the best price. Told us what they could do to reduce the price even more, and completed the job in a quick amount of time.  Highly recommend!! Would use them again and will refer them to everyone I know.   \n",

            "9                        I had an emotionally and legally difficult case. I felt an amazing degree of trust with Chelsea and Jordan. They were not only highly competent, but always seemed to be one step ahead of the other party. I also experienced them as incredibly rigorous, intelligent, and genuinely caring. When I would talk to them it always seemed like they deeply listened, and wanted to really get my world and fit that into the overall goal of the case. I’d go back to them in a heartbeat for any other legal matters   \n",

            "3  What a pleasure it was to work with Ben Emslie on the sale of my home!  I couldn't have chosen a better agent.   He was personable, knowledgeable about my neighborhood and so professional.  His experience made the whole process so easy.  He seemed genuinely excited about my home and did an exceptional job of marketing it, with the result that my home was under contract at full price after less than a week.  And he continued his support and assistance after closing.  I was lucky to find him. He's truly one of the best!   \n",

He came over in good time over the weekend to help get me back into my house for a reasonable price after I inadvertantly locked myself out.
